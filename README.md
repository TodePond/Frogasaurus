# Frogasaurus
Frogasaurus is a template for making a javascript project.<br>
It lets your project be compatible with traditional HTML script tag imports, as well as ES module imports.<br>

# How does it work?
Write your code inside the `source` folder.<br>
Then run the `make.js` file with [Deno](https://deno.land).<br>
Your bundled project will appear inside the `build` folder.<br>
